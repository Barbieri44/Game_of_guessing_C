# Game_of_guessing_C
This C file contains a number guessing game. It starts by generating a secret, random 4-digit number between 1000 and 9999. The player is given ten chances to guess this number. For each attempt, the program provides feedback by showing the player which digits they guessed correctly and placed in the right position.
