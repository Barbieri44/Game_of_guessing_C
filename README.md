# Game_of_guessing_C
This C file contains a number guessing game. It starts by generating a secret, random 4-digit number between 1000 and 9999. The player is given ten chances to guess this number. For each attempt, the program provides feedback by showing the player which digits they guessed correctly and placed in the right position.

To assist the player, the game introduces hints after the fifth incorrect guess. These hints provide clues about the still-unknown digits, indicating if they are even or odd, and whether they are greater or less than 5. The entire game, including its menu for viewing rules, playing, or exiting, is presented in Portuguese.
